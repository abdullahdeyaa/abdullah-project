<h1>INFORAMATION SECURITY</h1>
<h3>What is information secutity/h3>
<p>Information Security is not all about securing information from unauthorized access.<br> Information Security is basically the practice of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information. Information can be physical or electrical one. Information can be anything like Your details or we can say your profile on social media, your data in mobile phone, your biometrics etc. Thus Information Security spans so many research areas like Cryptography, Mobile Computing, Cyber Forensics, Online Social Media etc.<br>

During First World War, Multi-tier Classification System was developed keeping in mind sensitivity of information.<br> With the beginning of Second World War formal alignment of Classification System was done.<br> Alan Turing was the one who successfully decrypted Enigma Machine which was used by Germans to encrypt warfare data.<br>

Information Security programs are build around 3 objectives, commonly known as CIA – Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

<h2>NETWORK Security</h2><br>
Network security concept
Network security starts with authentication, commonly with a username and a password.<br> Since this requires just one detail authenticating the user name—i.e., the password—this is sometimes termed one-factor authentication. With two-factor authentication, something the user 'has' is also used (e.g., a security token or 'dongle', an ATM card, or a mobile phone); and with three-factor authentication,<br> something the user 'is' is also used (e.g., a fingerprint or retinal scan).<br>

Once authenticated, a firewall enforces access policies such as what services are allowed to be accessed by the network users.[1] Though effective to prevent unauthorized access, this component may fail to check potentially harmful content such as computer worms or Trojans being transmitted over the network<br>. Anti-virus software or an intrusion prevention system (IPS)[2] help detect and inhibit the action of such malware. An anomaly-based intrusion detection system may also monitor the network like wireshark traffic and may be logged for audit purposes and for later high-level analysis. Newer systems combining unsupervised machine learning with full network traffic analysis can detect active network attackers from malicious insiders or targeted external attackers that have compromised a user machine or account.[3]

Communication between two hosts using a network may be encrypted to maintain privacy.<br>

Honeypots, essentially decoy network-accessible resources,<br> may be deployed in a network as surveillance and early-warning tools, as the honeypots are not normally accessed for legitimate purposes.<br> Techniques used by the attackers that attempt to compromise these decoy resources are studied during and after an attack to keep an eye on new exploitation techniques.<br> Such analysis may be used to further tighten security of the actual network being protected by the honeypot<br>. A honeypot can also direct an attacker's attention away from legitimate servers. A honeypot encourages attackers to spend their time and energy on the decoy server while distracting their attention from the data on the real server. Similar to a honeypot,<br> a honeynet is a network set up with intentional vulnerabilities. Its purpose is also to invite attacks so that the attacker's methods can be studied and that information can be used to increase network security.<br> A honeynet typically contains one or more honeypots<br>.[4]

Security management
Security management for networks is different for all kinds of situations<br>. A home or small office may only require basic security while large businesses may require high-maintenance and advanced software and hardware to prevent malicious attacks from hacking and spamming. In order to minimize susceptibility to malicious attacks from external threats to the network<br>, corporations often employ tools which carry out network security verifications.<br>

Types of attacks
Networks are subject to attacks from malicious sources.<br> Attacks can be from two categories: "Passive" when a network intruder intercepts data traveling through the network, and "Active" in which an intruder initiates commands to disrupt the network's normal operation or to conduct reconnaissance and lateral movements to find and gain access to assets available via the network.[5]<br>

Types of attacks include:[6]<br>

Passive<br>
Network<br>
Wiretapping<br>
Port scanner<br>
Idle scan<br>
Encryption<br>
Traffic analysis<br><br>


<h2>Mobile security</h2>
Mobile security, or more specifically mobile device security,<br> has become increasingly important in mobile computing. Of particular concern is the security of personal and business information now stored on smartphones.<br>

More and more users and businesses use smartphones to communicate, but also to plan and organize their users' work and also private life. Within companies, these technologies are causing profound changes in the organization of information systems and therefore they have become the source of new risks.<br> Indeed, smartphones collect and compile an increasing amount of sensitive information to which access must be controlled to protect the privacy of the user and the intellectual property of the company.<br>

All smartphones, as computers, are preferred targets of attacks<br>. These attacks exploit weaknesses inherent in smartphones that can come from the communication mode—like Short Message Service (SMS, aka text messaging)<br>, Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS), WiFi, Bluetooth and GSM,<br> the de facto global standard for mobile communications. There are also exploits that target software vulnerabilities in the browser or operating system.<br> And some malicious software relies on the weak knowledge of an average user.<br>

Security countermeasures are being developed and applied to smartphones<br>, from security in different layers of software to the dissemination of information to end users. <br>There are good practices to be observed at all levels<br>, from design to use, through the development of operating systems, software layers, and downloadable apps.<br>
